This directory summarizes the studies done
to determine the depencence of the neural network
predictive power on the filter size used in the convolution.

A plot is made of the ratio: correct_predictions / (total images )
versus each of the focal plane plots, for each of the filter_size
configurations

This study serves to study the dependence of the model predictive
power  due to changes in the number of filters used



In the keras_optics.py script, the following parameters were used:

fixed parameters:
------------------
num_filters = 12
pool_size = 2
input_image=(200,200,1)
activation='softmax'
epochs=100

optimizer='adam'
loss='categorical_crossentropy'
metrics=['accuracy']


variable parameters:
---------------------
num_filters = 1, 6 or 12 ( filter_size = 3 config exists from previous study of num_filters)



Directory Structure:
--------------------
./Study1 : optics weights files and plots using filter_size = 1
./Study2 : optics weights files and plots using filter_size = 6
./Study3 : optics weights files and plots using filter_size = 12
